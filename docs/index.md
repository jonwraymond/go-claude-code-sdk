# Go Claude Code SDK

Welcome to the documentation for the Go Claude Code SDK.

This SDK provides an idiomatic Go wrapper around the Claude Code CLI, enabling AI-assisted development workflows from Go applications. It manages the CLI subprocess, supports streaming responses, sessions, tools, commands, MCP integration, and robust error handling.

If youâ€™re looking for the official Anthropic REST SDKs (Python/TS/Java/Ruby/Go) instead of the Claude Code CLI wrapper, see the Anthropic client SDKs page in the official docs.

Note on feature parity: this SDK targets Claude Code CLI capabilities and does not currently implement REST-only features like Message Batches or File Uploads from the Anthropic API. See README for details and roadmap.
