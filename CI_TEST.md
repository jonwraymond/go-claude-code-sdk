# CI Pipeline Test

This file is created to test the CI pipeline functionality after our recent fixes.

## What We're Testing

1. **Lint Job** - golangci-lint on ./pkg/... packages
2. **Test Matrix** - Unit tests across Go 1.20, 1.21, 1.22 on Linux, macOS, Windows
3. **Integration Tests** - Graceful handling of missing dependencies
4. **Build Job** - Compilation of core packages and example status
5. **Security Scan** - gosec security analysis
6. **Dependency Check** - Vulnerability scanning with govulncheck
7. **Documentation Check** - README and docs validation

## Expected Results

✅ All core package tests should pass  
✅ Build should succeed for ./pkg/... packages  
✅ Examples should report status but not fail CI  
✅ Integration tests should skip gracefully without API keys  
✅ Security and dependency checks should pass  
✅ Linting should pass with our current configuration  

## Changes Made

- Scoped all CI operations to ./pkg/... instead of ./...
- Added graceful fallback for integration tests
- Enhanced error handling for missing dependencies
- Made example compilation non-blocking

This PR tests these improvements work correctly in the GitHub Actions environment.
