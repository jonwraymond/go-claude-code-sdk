# Go Claude Code SDK Cleanup Workflow

## Overview
Comprehensive cleanup to remove Co-Authored-By signatures from git history and update Claude settings to prevent future signatures.

## Analysis Results
- **Current Status**: Working directory clean, 2 commits total
- **Commits with Co-Authored-By**: 2 commits (both have the signature)
- **Total Commits**: 2 (939487d Initial commit, 8c1816c Fix import paths)
- **Remote**: origin/main is up to date

## Todo List

### Phase 1: Update Claude Settings ✅
- [x] Read current .claude/settings.json file
- [x] Add "includeCoAuthoredBy": false setting
- [x] Validate JSON structure remains correct

### Phase 2: Safety Backup
- [ ] Create backup branch from current main
- [ ] Document current commit SHAs for reference
- [ ] Verify backup branch creation

### Phase 3: Clean Git History
- [ ] Use git filter-branch to remove Co-Authored-By lines from both commits
- [ ] Verify commit messages preserved except co-author signatures
- [ ] Check that file contents remain unchanged

### Phase 4: Force Push Updates
- [ ] Force push cleaned history to origin/main
- [ ] Verify remote repository reflects changes
- [ ] Confirm both commits cleaned successfully

### Phase 5: Final Validation
- [ ] Check git log shows no Co-Authored-By signatures
- [ ] Verify all files and functionality intact
- [ ] Test Claude settings prevent future signatures

## Execution Strategy
1. **Conservative approach**: Use git filter-branch for surgical removal
2. **Safety first**: Create backup branch before any history rewriting
3. **Minimal impact**: Only remove Co-Authored-By lines, preserve everything else
4. **Validation**: Thoroughly verify changes before and after

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Claude settings updated to prevent future Co-Authored-By signatures
- [ ] Git history cleaned of all Co-Authored-By signatures
- [ ] All commits and file contents preserved exactly
- [ ] Remote repository updated with clean history
- [ ] Backup branch available for emergency restoration

## Risk Mitigation
- Backup branch created before any destructive operations
- Force push only after local validation
- Conservative git filter-branch command
- Step-by-step verification at each phase
