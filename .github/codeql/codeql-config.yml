# CodeQL configuration for Go Claude Code SDK
# This configuration helps reduce false positives in security scanning

name: "Go Claude Code SDK CodeQL config"

# Paths to exclude from analysis
# Note: This is primarily for documentation purposes as CodeQL 
# doesn't directly support path exclusions in the config file
# These patterns should be handled via filter-sarif if needed
paths-ignore:
  - tests/fixtures/
  - "**/testdata/"
  - "**/*_test.go"

# Query filters - focus on high-confidence security issues
# Reduce noise from low-severity or experimental queries
query-filters:
  - exclude:
      id: go/hardcoded-credentials
      severity: 
        - recommendation
        - warning
  - exclude:
      id: go/clear-text-logging
      severity:
        - error
        - warning
  - exclude:
      tags contain: 
        - experimental
        - deprecated
